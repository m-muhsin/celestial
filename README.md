# Celestial theme
A WordPress theme using React 16, Bootstrap 4 and Webpack 3.

This is a support project of the article I wrote for Smashing Magazine. https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/react-wordpress-web-app

Update (July 25, 2018):
1. Got rid of jQuery and other enqueued script files
2. Updated footer with dynamic year and center text
3. Used the Loader where appropriate
4. Updated almost all packaages (React to v16.4.1)

I intend to continue developing the project by building the Next Steps of the article in the **'next-steps'** branch.
